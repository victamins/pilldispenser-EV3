# Pill Dispenser Lego EV3 Project
# Introduction
For our MTE100 final project, we created an automatic pill dispensing robot that can track patients, keep track of medication, and dispense pills. 

Acknowledgements to Professor C.C.W Hulls for creating file input/output syntax for RobotC as well as our MTE100 and MTE121 professors and teaching team. Thank you for supporting our project.  

Please refer to our project report for more details.

Our robot is equipped with a dispensing mechanism, Gyro, IR and touch sensors. We are very happy with how accurately and consistently our robot performs its tasks, especially given the short timeframe for this project.

Notes: 
- The video is sped up, 2x speed. 
- The robot waits 10s between dispenses.
- The second dispense is an unexpected case, when the patient doesn't press the button and take the medication. The robot will alert the patient by beeping and waiting before returning and not dispensing on the third iteration, to prevent overmedication.
